- move database pointers to the superblock
- make ported qsort work. The qsort call is in mp/mp_sync.c
- better way to get a new inode number for a new file, right now we are going through the entire 
  dirent table and finding out the max number.
- have some arrays in some functions, maybe we can make them dynamic
