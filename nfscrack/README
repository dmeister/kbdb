To use nfscrack with a new kernel:

1. Obtain the Linux 2.4.22 kernel sources (the code was written for 2.4.22, but
was also tested on 2.4.24).

2. In the configuration, set the NFS server to be compiled as a module.

3. Change the Makefile in the linux-2.4.22 directory to include -DNFSCRACK in the CFLAGS.

4. Copy the files from the archive into the linux-2.4.22/fs/nfsd directory.

5. Compile the kernel as usual (with 'make modules', 'make modules_install', etc).

6. Boot the machine with the new kernel.

7. insmod kbdb.o (this is the database that nfscrack uses)

8. /sbin/modprobe -a nfsd

9. /etc/init.d/nfs start

10. You can now write into /proc/fs/nfs/nfscrack to set the random file handle
size (a multiple of 4 between 4 and 64.

11. Export and use the NFS server as usual.

----------------------------------------------

Modifying nfscrack:

Since the NFS server was compiled into the kernel as a module (see above), the
kernel does not need to be recompiled for changes to take effect.

1. make modules

2. Copy the new nfsd.o file to /lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/fs/nfsd/nfsd.o

3. proceed from step 7 above (assuming the kbdb and nfsd modules are not
currently insmodded).
